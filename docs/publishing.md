# Publishing Guide

This guide is for maintainers of the **Arete** project.

## Part 1: PyPI (The Python Package)

### 1. Check if it exists
Go to: [https://pypi.org/project/arete/](https://pypi.org/project/arete/)
*If you see a 404, it is NOT published yet.*

### 2. How to Publish
You need to upload the artifacts built in `dist/`.

1.  **Create Account**: [Register on PyPI](https://pypi.org/account/register/).
2.  **Get Token**: [Account Settings](https://pypi.org/manage/account/) -> API Tokens -> Add API Token (Scope: Entire Account).
3.  **Run Command**:
    ```bash
    uv publish
    ```
    *   **Username**: `__token__`
    *   **Password**: `pypi-AgEIpy...` (Your full token)

Once successful, `pip install arete` will work for everyone.

## Part 2: GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

The project uses GitHub Actions to automate testing and releases.

-   **Test Workflow**: Runs on every PR and push to `main`. It executes `pytest` (with Dockerized Anki) and `ruff`.
-   **Release Workflow**: Triggered when a new GitHub Tag is pushed (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
    -   Automatically builds the Python `dist/` artifacts.
    -   Automatically builds the Obsidian Plugin (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`).
    -   Attaches all binaries to the GitHub Release.
    -   (Optional) Pushes to PyPI if Trusted Publishing is configured.

## Part 3: Obsidian Community Plugins

To get your plugin into the official list inside Obsidian, you must submit a Pull Request to the Obsidian team.

### Prerequisites
1.  **GitHub Release**: You must have a published Release with `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` attached.
2.  **Repo Structure**: `manifest.json` must be at the root of the repo (or root of released files). *Note: We release from `obsidian-plugin/`, but the build process handles the file placement.*

### Submission Steps
1.  **Fork** the [obsidian-releases](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases) repository.
2.  **Add Entry**: Add your plugin to `community-plugins.json` in their repo.
    *   Format:
        ```json
        {
          "id": "arete",
          "name": "Arete",
          "author": "Adam Nguyen",
          "description": "Sync Obsidian vault to Anki with topological queues and FSRS support.",
          "repo": "Adanato/Arete"
        }
        ```
3.  **Submit PR**: Open a Pull Request on their repo.

## Part 4: Versioning Strategy

We follow **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

-   **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (e.g., changes to the Markdown card syntax).
-   **MINOR**: New features (e.g., support for a new Anki field type).
-   **PATCH**: Bug fixes and documentation updates.

Always update `version` in `pyproject.toml` and `manifest.json` simultaneously to keep the CLI and Plugin in sync.

## Part 5: AnkiWeb (Add-on Store)

> [!NOTE]
> **Official Recommendation**: The Anki team officially recommends manual uploads via the AnkiWeb dashboard. However, for continuous delivery, the community uses automation scripts.

AnkiWeb does not have an official public API for uploading add-ons. To automate this, we recommend using a web-automation script in GitHub Actions.

### 1. Automation with `anki-addon-uploader`

You can use the `anki-addon-uploader` tool to programmatically push updates to AnkiWeb. Since it is not on PyPI, you should install it directly from the official source or use a similar community script.

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install https://github.com/ankitects/anki-addon-uploader/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```

**GitHub Secrets Required:**
- `ANKIWEB_USER`: Your AnkiWeb login email.
- `ANKIWEB_PASS`: Your AnkiWeb password.

**GitHub Action Step Example:**
```yaml
- name: Upload to AnkiWeb
  run: |
    pip install anki-addon-uploader
    export ANKIWEB_USER="${{ secrets.ANKIWEB_USER }}"
    export ANKIWEB_PASS="${{ secrets.ANKIWEB_PASS }}"
    # replace 123456789 with your real AnkiWeb ID
    anki-addon-uploader 123456789 release_artifacts/arete_ankiconnect.zip
```

### 2. Finding your AnkiWeb ID
After your first manual upload to [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/), the URL of your add-on page will contain the ID (e.g., `https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/123456789`). This ID must be used for all subsequent updates.

## Part 6: BRAT (Beta Testing Distribution)

The **BRAT** (Beta Reviewers Auto-update Tool) plugin allows users to install Obsidian plugins directly from GitHub before they are officially published.

### How it works
BRAT looks for the released artifacts (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`) in your **GitHub Releases**. Since our CI/CD pipeline already attaches these files to every release, **Arete is native-BRAT compatible out of the box.**

### Instructions for Users
To test the pre-release version of Arete:
1.  Install the **BRAT** plugin from the Obsidian Community Store.
2.  Open BRAT settings -> "Add Beta plugin".
3.  Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/Adanato/Arete`.
4.  BRAT will download the latest release and keep it auto-updated.

### Important for Maintainers
-   Ensure the `manifest.json` version matches the GitHub Release tag.
-   Do **not** change the filenames of the attached binaries (`main.js`, etc.). BRAT expects these exact names.
